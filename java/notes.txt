always wrap classes in packages, unless they are small/temporary

when compiling, always compile from parent folder
* only need to compile main file
ie javac child/<java-file>.java
... javac calculus/Main.java
... dont compile dependencies, ie vector stuff

when exectuing, always execute from parent folder
ie java <package-name>.<file-name>
... javac calculus.Main
